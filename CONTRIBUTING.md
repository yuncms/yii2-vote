# Contributing rules

Before write new code, desirable to create an issue to discuss about your proposal.

Steps for creating good pull request:
* Your code must conform [Yii2 code style](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/blob/master/docs/internals/core-code-style.md)
* Much as possible describe your commit messages
